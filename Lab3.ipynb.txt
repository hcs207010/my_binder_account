    "1. Write a program that takes as input 5 integer numbers and outputs the largest even number\n",
    "2. Print odd numbers from 0-100 using the range function and its arguments.\n",
    "3. Let *s* be a string that contains a sequence of decimal numbers separated by commas, e.g., *s = '1.23,2.4,3.123'*. Write a program that prints the sum of the numbers in *s*. Keep in mind the type of numbers these are (not `int`!).\n",
    "4. Can you write the exhaustive enumeration program (second one) which contains `while` loop using a `for` loop instead? It should print out the right answer or indicate that a perfect cube doesn't exist.\n",
    "5. The function `split` in Python will automatically split a given string by a delimiter (by default, this is space). For example, a string such as `I grew a ficus tree` gets split into its individual elements `'I', 'grew','a', 'ficus','tree'`. Can you write a program that implements the split function using loops and conditionals? (obviously, you cannot use the split() function itself). Your expected output will simply be a string with the individual words separated by commas e.g. `I,grew,a,ficus,tree`. For the moment, the program only needs to work on a sentence with words separated by space.\n"
